* WHEN I view the UV index THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

* WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
