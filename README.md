## Task Describtion

This is a code related quiz application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This application demonstrates the use of Javascript to provide quiz questions & answers and collect user data to determine whether the answers to a question is correct. After it generates a score and appends a highscore page of results from the user data.

This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. Please follow the deployed link which is displayed in (#general-informaion) to start the quiz.

The task/ homework should prepare us for the journey to become a full-stack developer as we will likely be asked to complete a coding assessment perhaps as part of an interview process.
The webpage is a timed coding quiz, which confornts the user with multiple-choice questions.


## Actual Behaviour

* WHEN I click the start button THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

* WHEN I answer a question THEN I am presented with another question

* WHEN I answer a question incorrectly THEN time is subtracted from the clock

* WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 THEN the game is over

* WHEN the game is over THEN I can save my initials and my score

## üèÜ Bonus


* WHEN I answer a question THEN the correct or wrong question will be displayed on the webpage

* The start webpage allows the user to go straight to the highscore page

* WHEN I save my initials and score I will see a highscore screen

* WHEN I click the -clear all scores- button, the local Storage gets cleared.
